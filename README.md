# PLC-FluidSim-LogixPro

This repository contains examples of programming with PLC electropneumatics, pneumatics and ladder circuits. Some important points are:

- The repository is organized in three folders: Pneumatics Programs, PLC Programs and Electropneumatics Programs. Each folder contains FluidSim simulation files and LogixPro programming files.
- FluidSim is a software that allows designing and simulating pneumatic and electro-pneumatic circuits. LogixPro is a software that allows programming and simulating PLCs using the ladder language.
- FluidSim files have the extension .pne or .ele, depending on the type of circuit. LogixPro files have the extension .plc or .lsc, depending on the type of PLC.
- To open FluidSim files you need to have FluidSim software installed on your computer. Opening LogixPro files requires LogixPro software to be installed on your computer.
- PLC programming examples show how to control different types of actuators (cylinders, valves, motors, etc.) using sensors (limit switches, pushbuttons, switches, etc.) and Boolean logic (AND, OR, NOT, etc. ).
- Examples of programming with electropneumatics show how to integrate pneumatic circuits with electrical circuits using relays, contactors, timers, etc.
- Examples of programming with pneumatics show how to design pneumatic circuits using valves, distributors, regulators, etc.
